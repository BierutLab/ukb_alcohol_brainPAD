This is the code used to conduct analyses of UK Biobank data for the paper "Alcohol consumption is associated with accelerated brain aging". We welcome use and adaptation of this data processing pipeline, please cite the paper if doing so!

This pipeline is an adaptation of a core version available at https://github.com/verathor14/ukbio_pipeline. This has several additional processing steps and a large set of covariates suitable to adapt to various processing piplines for UK Biobank data. The core pipeline repo contains a word file with an extensive description of each processing step and how it works.
